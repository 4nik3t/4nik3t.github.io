### What is your public CIBIL score.

If you have ever been using a credit card, you must have been aware of the CIBIL score. For those who don't know, it a metric which determines how have you paid your bills in the past and it helps the credit card company to determine they can provide you loans in future.

So what is a public CIBIL score?

The public CIBIL Score is the score you have to give to yourself based on how many times have you lend money from a friend and relatives and have you returned that money back on time. If you have a bad score then you are in trouble. 

Why should you focus on your public CIBIL Score?

Consider you are need a certain amount that you are damn sure you will return in a week or a month. If you approach a bank you will get a loan along with the interest amount. Instead of paying the interest amount you can easily lend money from your friend or relative with no interest rates. I would suggest returning a particular amount in return in form of a gift or anything else to strenghten the relations more and also they will think less anytime later when making a payment on your behalf.

As soon as I entered into this competitive world (at my first job). I have come across people having discussions about investments and savings. I am doing the same here in this blog post. Here are the different types of investments you can make: 

## Self Investment

This should be your first investment and you have to make sure some amount of your income is going back into yourself. There is no higher returns anywhere else other than yourself. Self investment can come in many forms here are some:

1. Health

In India, there is a saying "Jaan hai to Jahan hai", which simply means If you have good health you will have everything in the world. You should atleast make some efforts to invest in your health so that you stay in the competition.

2. Knowledge

This one is simple. Knowledge is Power. This investment can be in the form of books, courses , learning new skills and adventures.

## Investing on Relations ( Directly Known People) 

### What is your public CIBIL score?

If you have ever been using a credit card, you must have been aware of the CIBIL score. For those who don't know, it a metric which determines how have you paid your bills in the past and it helps the credit card company to determine they can provide you loans in future.

So what is a public CIBIL score?

The public CIBIL Score is the score you have to give to yourself based on how many times have you lend money from a friend and relatives and have you returned that money back on time. If you have a bad score then you are in trouble. 

Why should you focus on your public CIBIL Score?

Consider you are need a certain amount that you are damn sure you will return in a week or a month. If you approach a bank you will get a loan along with the interest amount. Instead of paying the interest amount you can easily lend money from your friend or relative with no interest rates. I would suggest returning a particular amount in return in form of a gift or anything else to strenghten the relations more and also they will think less anytime later when making a payment on your behalf.

### Strengthen your relations

Spending some of your savings in your friends and family is essential in order to have a happy environment around you. At the end of the day, you earn money to make you happy and lead a better life. You should not think of this as a wasteful investment in anyways. Setting a monthly budget is useful in order to keep this kind of expenses to a safe limit.

## Savings Account

If you have a huge amount of cash with you, there are surely two things that will happen. First, you will be worried about its security from theft and damages. Secondly, the liquidity of cash allows you to spend it too easily. Savings account help you get away from this insecurity and also you will not be tempted to spend that amount. Savings banks have a interest rate of 3% p.a, which does not even beat inflation. So to conclude, you should definitely have a savings account but it does not have any ROI ( Return on Investment).

## Fixed Deposit

Am I sure most people would be aware of this investment. You can invest a particular amount for a fixed time and earn a fixed interest on that amount. The higher the period the better the overall interest. FD's generally have a higher interest rate than inflation.This is one of the safest form of investments and you must definitely have a certain amount of your money in fixed deposit. From my perspective, you should keep atleast 4 to 6 times of your salary as FD. Banks offer loans on those FD so in those times when you lose you job. This money can come to the rescue to pay your bills.

## Recurring Deposit

Now that we know about Fixed Deposit, we have a problem coming up with the higher principal amount for Fixed Deposit. For this, we can make use of Recurring Deposits, a certain amount of money which you provide will automatically get deducted every month. The whole money will be returned to you along with interest at maturity. Recurring Deposit have a slightly less interest over FD. Due to its nature, it gives you some discipline to save money and makes it easy for you.

## Real Estate 

Home Sweet Home. This is a person's most important investment in his life. I am yet to make this amazing investment and I will come back to this in future.

Migrations in laravel are a fantastic tool for maintaining database integrity and versioning. But there are certain things to know about before running a migration on your production application. Here is a checklist for the same:

- [ ] Migrations should have both the up and down methods.
- [ ] If you have added any new columns to the database make sure they are nullable or set a default value to them.
- [ ] Do not make any modification to the already executed migration files that would alter the database structure, you can make bug fixes thats okay.
